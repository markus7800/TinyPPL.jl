TODOS:

- speed up and fix junction tree (like greedy variable elimination)
- document variable elimination belief propagation etc
- belief propagation with queue instead of recursion
- reduce compile time in graph by batching distributions, observed_values functions similar to plated

- AQUA inference for graphsample
- 
- document everyting


- rjmcmc
- smc (graph ok / universial with channels?)
- logjoint -> logdensity
- graph -> enfore static observes
- variational inference result type, rand -> auto transform to constrained
