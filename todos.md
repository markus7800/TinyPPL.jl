TODOS:

- speed up and fix junction tree (like greedy variable elimination)
- document variable elimination belief propagation etc
- belief propagation with queue instead of recursion
- reduce compile time in graph by batching distributions, observed_values functions similar to plated
- hmc evaluation based
- AQUA inference for graphsample
